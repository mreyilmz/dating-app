<!-- The page will make the error disappear because if you do refresh the page, then you're no longer being redirected to this component via the Http interceptor and the navigation extras will be gone. We won't have access to them, we only get access to them when we're being redirected. And at that point we're passing the error to the navigation extras. So only initially we'll have will we have access to that information. 

NOTE: In newer versions of Angular (since 15) this state is preserverd even after refreshing.

    <ol>
        <li>Open the chrome dev tools and check the failing request in the network tab</li>
        <li>Examine the request URL - what API endpoint are you requesting?</li>
        <li>Reproduce the error in Postman - if we get the same error then Angular is not the problem</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">Following is the stack trace - the first 2 lines will tell you which line of code in the API caused the issue</p>
